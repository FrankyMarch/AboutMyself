    <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>

    <h4>Here you will find the most interesting information about Mariia Samorodova</h4>
    <br><br>
    <p>To begin with, I would like to tell you some basic information about myself. My name is Mariia and my
        birthday coincides with the Independence Day of my country - Ukraine. I graduated from the Theater
        and Art
        College in Dnipro, after which I tried myself in many professions.</p><br>
    <p>In the past I am an artist, I tried myself in oil and watercolor painting, drawing, pastel and other
        techniques. If you are interested in getting acquainted with my art, go to <a
                href="pages/gallery.html" target="_blank">my gallery.</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>I also realized myself in a tattoo. It is insanely interesting to create paintings with just a needle
        and pigment. Perhaps after visiting <a href="https://samorodova.pb.gallery/" target="_blank">this page</a> you will
        want to have
        something similar.</p><br>
    <p>I was fond of software testing, but over time I realized that I was more interested in writing code.</p>
    <p>You can find out more about me <a
            href="pages/about.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
